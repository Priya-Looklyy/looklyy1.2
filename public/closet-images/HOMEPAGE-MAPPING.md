## How to Upload Images

1. **Identify the Homepage Image**: Look at the homepage sliders to find which image you want to upload closet items for
2. **Find the Folder Number**: Use the mapping above to determine the correct `look-X` folder
3. **Upload Images**: Drop individual clothing items into that folder

## Example:
- If you want to upload closet items for "Slider 1, Image 3" (third image in the first slider)
- Upload images to: `public/closet-images/look-3/`

The system will automatically load these images into the closet interface!
